The past few days have been quite… interesting.

I decided to move past github and look to actual website hosting for our university club--the Aviation Club. As it turns out, website hosting is in fact complicated. It makes perfect sense to me now why websites like Squarespace, etc exist--a lot of people really don’t want to mess with all of it. There’s a lot of technobabble, a lot of ways to go wrong, and, to be honest, a lot of options. Choice paralysis is a big problem for me, so having to choose between dozens of different domain registrars was frustrating. However, I eventually settled on ([name.com]https://name.com/), purchased ([wwuaviation.com]https://wwuaviation.com/), and was on my way.

As I didn’t have an open computer to host a server, I had to go with the next best thing and use cloud hosting. Luckily, as a student, the Github Student Developer Pack gives me credit for DigitalOcean, meaning that my choice was made. For 0$ a month, I was provided with a server in San Francisco that I could .ssh into, upload files to, and run my websites from. I named it Akureyri, after the city in Iceland and the habitat in Neal Stephenson’s book Seveneves. After some guidance from a friend to host the webpage on Akureyri, a quick python file to make it work, and some patience, I had a working webapp that displayed the Navy Seals copypasta within 2 days of starting.

I think that feeling of seeing a webpage--even one so basic--that I had created was something magical. The internet is omnipresent in our lives, and to see something that I had created be a part of that infinite ocean was a very special feeling. I’m not sure if I can describe it. On a surface level, it’s the same as making a Reddit or Twitter account and posting there, but somehow it feels like it’s so much more.
