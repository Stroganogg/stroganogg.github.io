## Experience

I have worked on multiple long-term projects, all of which have been conducted with teams. 

### Flight by Design: Project Neuro

In my senior year of high school, I had the opportunity to take a yearlong project class called Flight by Design, where we were told to create </i>something</i>. Our group elected to create a neural network from scratch--without any prior programming experience. Over the course of the year, we learned how to code in python and simultaneously learned how neural networks worked and learn--but more importantly, we learned how to use git, how to keep good documentation, how to use comments efficiently, how to review the code of others, and how to effectively split up work and work in a group. You can see the full project folder here<br />[neuralnetwork]<br />.

### International Space Settlement Design Competition (ISSDC)

ISSDC was a competitive club that I was involved with throughout my senior year. We started in mid-October and had until late April to design a space station based on a 5-page-long Request for Proposal (RFP). We worked in a team that dwindled from about 30 people at the beginning to about 4 people and myself at the end. The contest required us to design everything from power management systems to house designs and park layouts--and they all had to be consistent within the teams. The organization and communication was much more difficult than the designing itself, and it was great experience in project management and teamwork.
