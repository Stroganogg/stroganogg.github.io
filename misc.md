## Technical Interests

I have tinkered with many small technical projects, including programming, custom model rocketry, Wii homebrew, Arduino projects, and more. You can see some of my projects on the [main page](/default/), and I post occasional updates to projects on the [blog](/default/blog/).

## History

I love reading and discussing history and geopolitics. My favorite subjects include Polynesian, American, Spanish, and Mexican history.
