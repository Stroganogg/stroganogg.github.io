<p>I have tinkered with many small technical projects, including programming, custom model rocketry, Wii homebrew, Arduino projects, and more. You can see some of my projects on the <a href="/">main page</a>, and I post occasional updates to projects on the <a href="/blog/">blog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>I love reading and discussing history and geopolitics. My favorite subjects include Polynesian, American, Spanish, and Mexican history.</p>
