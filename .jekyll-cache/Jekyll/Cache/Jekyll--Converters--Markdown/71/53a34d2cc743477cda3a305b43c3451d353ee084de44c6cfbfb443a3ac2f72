I"y<p>It seems odd to post to a blog in 2019. It’s like sending your voice out into a crowded street, using a pager from 1999. It doesn’t really work. Yet here I am, putting text into a jekyll theme to make that pager heard. I initially started this page upon a recommendation from a friend to a web development job that he convinced me I “totally had the skill for.”</p>
