I"T<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>I am a fast-paced learner and am eager to work in any environment. I have accumulated skills in fields of interest to me, including computer science, mathematics, and engineering. Most of this has come from my education in a STEM-based high school, Raisbeck Aviation. I am also interested in aviation/aerospace, the design of strategy games, CAD and 3D printing, and much more.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Raisbeck Aviation High School (Sep 2016 to Jun 2019)</li>
  <li>
    <p>A STEM- and aviation-based high school in Tukwila, WA. I took classes with names such as Flight by Design, Aviation Law, History of Aircraft Design, and incorporated college classes from the UW in my coursework.</p>
  </li>
  <li>WWU (Sep 2019 to present)</li>
  <li>I am currently pursuing a major in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Astronomy. This involves a courseload heavy in computer science, mathematics, physics, and technical writing.</li>

<h3 id="museum-of-flight-visitor-services">Museum of Flight Visitor Services</h3>
<p>I worked at the Museum of Flight in Seattle, WA, for 3 consecutive summers from 2017 to 2019, where I performed a variety of different tasks. These changed often and included selling admission to guests, providing information, assisting them in and off of rides, organizing displays, and more. I learned to explain things in a way that made sense to anyone I was assisting, including people who had little-to-no English skills or that had never experienced anything similar before.</p>

<h3 id="taco-time-customer-service-representative">Taco Time Customer Service Representative</h3>
<p>I worked at Taco Time as a temporary job for a couple months in the spring of 2019. I washed dishes, cleaned the dining area, and served customers their food. I learned to work under tight constraints due to the fast-paced nature of a restaurant.</p>

<h2 id="technical-projects">Technical Projects</h2>

<p>I spent my senior year of high school working with two other people creating a computational neural network from scratch in python. We started with zero experience and were restrained by the bounds of our project class, but we learned to work in a team, document our code, use project management software, give periodic progress reports, and self-teach coding. I spent a lot of my time working on data visualization and analysis, as well as explaining how code works in laymanâ€™s terms. Using this, we presented our project to a public audience at the Museum of Flight, where our team won the award for the best team project.</p>

<p>Last December, I went to some close friends about creating a website. They recommended I use Jekyll to handle the frontend, and within a couple of days I had a fully functioning website. I used this skill again to create my final project for my HNRS 103 class, where I created a timeline of ancient culture.</p>

<p>In high school, I was a member of the International Space Settlement Design Competition (ISSDC) team. We had to create a 50-page proposal for a space station, based on a request for proposal (RFP) sent out in December and due in April. The challenging part was not designing the stationâ€“it was delegating tasks, working in a team of dozens of people, and meeting the due date. Our team went to internationals at Kennedy Space Center three years in a row, two of which we won. Internationals involved working with 60 other people from teams all around the world, which formed a megateam, and creating the same type of proposal in two days rather than 4 months.</p>
